            There were many difficulties I faced when trying to complete this webpage. One of which is the fact that React functions in a very unique way using components rather than just straight HTML code. This required me to think about the project in a new way and do a lot of reasearch on how things were formatted. Additionally, I faced a challenge when trying to use the CSS styling since React uses the JSX formatting rather than the CSS fromatting we had learned in class. Overall, it is very clear to see that React functions in a very unique way to the other frameworks we have covered and that it will take a long time for me to fully grasp all of it. IT seems that there are lots of possibilties for this however, and that pursuing react will allow me to make great webpages in hte future.
